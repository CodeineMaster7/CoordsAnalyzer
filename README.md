CoordsAnalyzer is a simple and handy application for monitoring the cursor's coordinates on the screen. The program displays the current X and Y coordinates, which are updated in real time inside a square that follows the cursor's movement.

By pressing the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + C, the coordinates are copied to the clipboard, allowing you to quickly use them in other applications or processes.

This app is useful for anyone working with graphics, maps, or any task that requires precise cursor location information.
